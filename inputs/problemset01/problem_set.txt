# ^ first line has to be recognized as format-version
# <-- pound sign in position 0 of a line makes line a comment
# ----- or more at start (twice) is item delimeter. top and bottom of each item
# then problem uniq-id (unique across problem set)
# then answer
# then tag1,tag2,... tag names use most chars (within reason?) except quotes and: ',_~!'
# then ---
# the rest (until delimiter) will be inserted into the LaTeX worksheet
##### when printing sheet, would be nice to add datetime
##### nice-to-have: print summary of all tags. find 'distance' between tags in case plural is only distinguishing feature
